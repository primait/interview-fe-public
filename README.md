# Prima Frontend Pairing exercise

Thank you sharing for your interest in [Prima Engineering](https://inside.helloprima.com/). This repo contains an exercise we would like you to do with us in our pairing session.
We would like to proceed with a 60 - 75 minutes session where you will be talking with our engineers and doing pair programming. You will play the role of driver (sharing your screen and coding) while the Prima engineer(s) will be the navigator(s).

The coding exercise allows us to assess your approach to solving a problem, what you prioritise, how you communicate your thinking and how you respond to any suggestions or advice from our engineers. In addition to the coding we will ask you some questions you don't need to implement.

Clone this repo to prepare your working environment and familiarise yourself with the structure of the application. *We will be sharing the problem statement with you at the pairing session*.

Should you have any questions, write to our talent partner which will get the question to the engineering team.

This repo is a stub of a screen for our customer service agents to search for policy information while on the phone. **During the interview we will share with you what you would need to build**.
